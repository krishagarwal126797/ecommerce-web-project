Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Shopzone.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>



<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Protection of Shopzone and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Shopzone, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>



</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 43px;">Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</h2>

<h1 style="font-size: 58px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 43px;margin-left: 50px;">We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</h2>

<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.</li>

<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.</li>
<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>



<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.</li>
<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Shopzone account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </li>

<h1 style="font-size: 58px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">What About Advertising?</h1>

<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: </strong>Shopzone Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Shopzone, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page.</li>

<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong>We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Shopzone ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases, product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve you with more effective Shopzone ads. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page.</li>
</ul>

</section><section id="part8">
<h1 style="font-size: 58px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">What Choices Do I Have?</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 43px;margin-left: 50px;">If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Customer Service. Many of our Shopzone Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used.</h2>

<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Shopzone Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our Cookies Notice. </li>

<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Shopzone website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"), device, or application. For more information click here. Most non-Shopzone devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.</li>
<li style="font-size: 50px;margin-left: 50px;">If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your Notification Preferences.</li>
